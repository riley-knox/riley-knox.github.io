### Code

The code for this project can be found in [this GitHub repository.](https://github.com/riley-knox/Object-Drawing)

### Description

This project uses color-based image segmentation to identify a) the object being used as the paintbrush and b) the gesture indicating what the user wants to do. The algorithm recognizes three gestures that allow the user to draw (two fingers), erase (open hand), or move the brush without interacting with the canvas (closed fist).
