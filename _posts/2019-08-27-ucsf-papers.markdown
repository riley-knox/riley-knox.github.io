### Background

From January 2017 - August 2019, I worked as a Biomechanics and Orthopedic Surgery R&D Engineer at the Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, an orthopedic surgery clinic and research facility at the University of California, San Francisco. I was the principal engineer on more than two dozen laboratory and clinical studies on topics ranging from the mechanical behavior of implanted devices to post-surgical outcomes to the use of 3D printing as a diagnostic and treatment tool. My work was published five times in domestic and international medical journals and featured in poster presentations at several conferences. You can read a brief description of each published paper below; follow the link in each section to view the full text.

#### Augmenting Long-Bone Fixation with Mini-fragment Plates

Full Title: ["The influence of mini-fragment plates on the mechanical properties of long-bone plate fixation."](https://riley-knox.github.io/misc/ucsf_mini_frag_plates.pdf)

Mini-fragment plates are small orthopedic fixation plates often used to provisionally stabilize a fracture while a surgeon applies a larger, definitive fixation plate. However, the surgeon must then decide whether to remove the smaller plates or leave them in place, based on how they think the small plates will mechanically influence the fixation construct. The construct must stabilize the fracture enough to allow for sufficient healing, but must also not be too stiff, as this can also impede the healing process. We tested two humerus fracture models in torsion and 4-point bending, with and without the added mini-fragment plates, to determine how the extra plates influence the constructs' mechanical properties. We found that the extra plates statistically increase torsional stiffness and 4-point bending stiffness under certain loading conditions.

#### Detecting Compartment Syndrome Using Ultrasound

Full Title: ["Use of standard musculoskeletal ultrasound to determine the need for fasciotomy in an elevated muscle compartment pressure cadaver leg model."](https://riley-knox.github.io/misc/ucsf_ultrasound_comp_synd.pdf)

Compartment syndrome is a rare but very serious traumatic or post-surgical complication in which pressure builds up in a muscle compartment, disrupting blood flow to the area. If not treated in a timely manner, compartment syndrome can cause nerve and blood vessel damage, limb loss, or even death. Diagnosis of compartment syndrome is inconsistent and often depends on subjective factors or invasive measurement procedures. We induced elevated compartment pressures in a cadaver model by introducing fluid to the muscle compartment. Using an ultrasound transducer combined with a pressure sensing transducer, we measured the size of the compartment and the pressure required to flatten its superficial membrane. We found that both the compartment measurement and the pressure required to flatten it correlated very well with intracompartmental pressure, indicating a potential for clinical use of ultrasound in the diagnosis of compartment syndrome.
