The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a medical test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. The ECG measures voltages over time and can detect irregularities in the timing and progression of the heart's contractile process.

For this project, I built an ECG circuit and recorded the activity of my heart. You can see a recording of the output signal here, and read about the technical details of the project below. I'm happy to report that the ECG shows no abnormal behavior!
