## Welcome to my profile!

My name is Riley Knox. I am an aspiring robotics engineer whose interests include surgical applications, computer vision, and bio-integrated robotics. I also enjoy tackling projects in 3D printing, electronic prototyping, manufacturing/production, and more. You can see many of these projects on my homepage or in the 'Projects' section. I hope something here sparks your curiosity!

I received my BS in Biomedical Engineering from the University of California, Davis in 2015. I am currently a first-year student in the Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University, with an expected graduation date in December 2020.

I started my professional career on the engineering and production teams at LIM Innovations, a prosthetics manufacturer in San Francisco. I then spent more than two and a half years as an Orthopedic Surgery and biomechanics R&D engineer at the Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, a research and education facility at the University of California, San Francisco. You may learn more about my professional experience in my 'Resume' section, or feel free to [contact me](mailto:riley.m.knox@gmail.com) directly.

I was born and raised 10 miles north of San Francisco in Marin County, California and currently live in Evanston, Illinois. Outside of engineering, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, snowboarding, reading, and cooking. I am emphatically a dog person.

I am exploring internships for Summer 2020 and am available for full-time work at the start of 2021.
