					Welcome to my portfolio! I hope you find something here that sparks
					your curiosity.
				</p>

				<p>
					I am currently a first-year student in the Master of Science in Robotics
					program at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.	I received my
					Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Davis in 2015 in
					Biomedical Engineering. You can learn more about me in my 'About' section.
				</p>

				<p>
					Below, I have listed the various projects I've worked on. Click on a project
					tile for in-depth information, or head to the 'Projects' page to see a short
					description of each.

				<p>
					Professionally, I have worked in the prosthetics industry and spent more
					than two and a half years in the Orthopedic Surgery department at the
					University of California, San Francisco. These experiences led to my
					fascination with medical robotics, particularly robotic surgery systems,
					and I hope to enter the medical robotics industry once I obtain my Master's.
					You may read more about these experiences in my 'Resume' section.
